# CSS Optimization Opportunity for Sortlist

## Context  
While analyzing the page https://www.sortlist.com/digital-marketing/united-states-us, we found that the CSS file 4a9a61b89f1c03a7.css could be significantly optimized for performance.

## Technical Setup  
I tried using PurgeCSS to strip unused CSS from this file. It was a bit tricky due to the Node.js setup and how the styles are bundled via Next.js, but I managed to isolate the relevant styles used by the HTML for that page.

Here’s the script used:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

CSS_URL="https://www.sortlist.com/_next/static/css/4a9a61b89f1c03a7.css"
HTML_URL="https://www.sortlist.com/digital-marketing/united-states-us"

echo "Downloading CSS"
curl -s -L "$CSS_URL" -o style.css

echo "Downloading HTML"
curl -s -L "$HTML_URL" -o page.html

echo "Running PurgeCSS..."
mkdir -p purged
npx purgecss --css style.css --content page.html --output purged/ > /dev/null 2>&1

# File size check
ORIGINAL_SIZE=$(stat -f%z style.css)
PURGED_SIZE=$(stat -f%z purged/style.css)
REDUCTION_PERCENT=$(awk "BEGIN {printf "%.1f", (($ORIGINAL_SIZE - $PURGED_SIZE) / $ORIGINAL_SIZE) * 100}")

# Diff output
diff -u style.css purged/style.css > css-diff.txt

# Summary report
cat <<EOF > css-optimization-summary.txt
# CSS Optimization Report

**URL analyzed**: $HTML_URL  
**Original CSS file**: $CSS_URL

## Results

- Original size: $((ORIGINAL_SIZE / 1024)) KB
- Purged size: $((PURGED_SIZE / 1024)) KB
- Reduction: ${REDUCTION_PERCENT} %

## Removed Rules

See `css-diff.txt` for a detailed diff (lines starting with "-" were removed).

## Conclusion

This demonstrates that a large portion of unused CSS is shipped to clients. This can negatively impact load time, Core Web Vitals, and SEO scores.  
Optimizing or modularizing your CSS can significantly improve performance.

echo "Report generated: css-optimization-summary.txt"
```

## Summary Report

- Original CSS Size: 404 KB  
- After Purge: 9 KB  
- Reduction: ~97.8%  

## Conclusion  
The current static CSS contains a substantial amount of unused styles. Even though this is expected in Next.js apps with shared CSS, it’s highly recommended to:

- Use per-page critical CSS or CSS modules
- Enable Tailwind’s `purge` option or Next.js' built-in CSS optimization
- Consider dynamic imports of styles if needed

Let me know if you'd like the diff file or final purged CSS attached.
