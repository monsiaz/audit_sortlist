High,üö®,[URGENT] Fix Invalid Sitemap,Issues/Technical/SEO/fix_invalid_sitemap_and_orphan_local_version.md,"Sitemap is unreadable by Google (not XML), preventing effective content discovery. Orphaned localized pages exist.","Generate a valid XML sitemap. Link or remove orphaned localized pages and manage hreflang.","Drastic improvement in crawl coverage and indexation. Clean international SEO signals."
High,üö´,[URGENT] Resolve Googlebot 403 Errors for Images,Issues/Technical/SEO/fix_403_image_indexing.md,"Googlebot is blocked (403) on /_next/image URLs, preventing optimized image indexing and wasting crawl budget.","Identify block source (WAF, CDN, server) and whitelist Googlebot for these paths.","Correct image indexing, GSC error resolution, crawl budget optimization."
High,üìÑ,[HIGH] Optimize Pagination Handling for Deep Content,Issues/Technical/SEO/fix_pagination_canonical_noindex.md,"noindex and canonical to page 1 on paginated pages >1 block deep content indexing and PR flow (including to agency pages).","Implement index, follow; self-referencing canonicals; degraded titles/meta for pages >1; limit depth.","Deep content indexing, better PR flow to /agency/ pages, long-tail capture, reduced zombie pages. Direct synergy with agency PR improvement."
High,üîó,[HIGH] Improve Agency Page Internal Linking Strategy,Issues/Technical/SEO/improve_agency_pr.md,"Critical /agency/ pages have low PR and are often zombie pages despite traffic potential.

High,‚ö°Ô∏è,[HIGH] Optimize JavaScript Bundle Performance,Issues/Performances/improve_js-bundle-perf-issue.md,"Excessive JS payload (~2.1MB uncompressed) negatively impacts Core Web Vitals and user experience, especially on mobile.","Audit JS bundles (@next/bundle-analyzer), tree-shaking, aggressive code-splitting (dynamic()), lazy-load third-party scripts.","Major improvement in LCP, TBT, TTI. Better PageSpeed scores, better mobile UX."
High,üé®,[HIGH] Optimize CSS Delivery and Purging,Issues/Performances/improve_css_optimization_ticket.md,"Large CSS file (~404KB) with unused styles is shipped, impacting load times and Core Web Vitals.","Implement CSS optimization: PurgeCSS, CSS modules, critical CSS generation, or dynamic imports for styles.","Faster rendering, improved LCP and PageSpeed scores, better mobile UX."
Medium,üõ°Ô∏è,[MEDIUM] Prevent API Endpoint Exposure in Frontend,Issues/Technical/SEO/prevent_api_exposure_ticket.md,"Internal /api/... URLs exposed in JS state, crawled by Googlebot (generating 410s), wasting crawl budget and polluting GSC.","Do not serialize API endpoints in hydrated state. Block /api/ in robots.txt. Harden API access (auth, 401/404 instead of 410).","Optimized crawl budget, cleaner GSC, enhanced security."
Medium,‚≠êÔ∏è,[MEDIUM] Fix AggregateRating Schema for Reviews,Issues/Technical/SEO/fix_review_schema_aggregaterating.md,"Missing aggregateRating on pages with multiple reviews, preventing star rich snippets in SERPs and causing GSC errors.","Dynamically add aggregateRating schema (calculating ratingValue and reviewCount) on relevant pages.","Eligibility for SERP stars (potentially higher CTR), GSC error resolution, improved trust signal."
Medium,üì∞,[MEDIUM] Develop Automated News Content Workflow,Issues/Content/automated_news_generation_workflow.md,"Current news generation workflow is manual, unscalable, and uses separate, unintegrated scripts. Generation script has bugs.","Automate end-to-end: full content retrieval (JS/paywall handling), integrate the two scripts, test models/sources/relevance, monitor traffic/backlinks. Focus on agency/company news for backlinks.","Scalable content production, freshness, potential for traffic/backlinks (if quality is high and technical issues are resolved)."
Medium,üìù,[MEDIUM] Improve Landing Page Content Quality via AI,Issues/Content/improve_contents_quality_landing_pages.md,"Landing page content (SEO text, FAQ) is often generic, lacking specificity and data-driven insights from available provider/service data, limiting engagement and SEO effectiveness.","Utilize AI (e.g., GPT models) with rich, aggregated provider data (ratings, team sizes, budgets, services, reviews, project examples) and specific market context to generate highly relevant, specific, and data-driven content for each landing page.","Improved content quality & relevance, better alignment with search intent, increased user engagement & trust, scalable creation of high-quality content, enhanced SEO performance."
Medium,üåê,[MEDIUM] Fix Mixed Language Content & Hreflang Issues,Issues/Content/avoid_mixed_language_content_urls.md,"Content served in a language different from URL signals (e.g., English content on /es/ path). Language selectors may not be crawlable. Inconsistent or incorrect hreflang implementation.","Ensure strict content-language-URL alignment. Implement correct and comprehensive hreflang tags. Ensure language selectors use crawlable static <a> links. Develop a robust translation strategy.","Improved international SEO, better UX for targeted languages, clearer signals to Google, reduced duplicate content risk, enhanced discoverability of language versions."
Medium,‚ùì,[MEDIUM] Fix/Implement FAQ Schema,Issues/Technical/SEO/fix_faq_schema.md,"FAQPage schema is invalid on some pages (e.g., mainEntity array is empty) or missing, preventing eligibility for FAQ rich results in SERPs.","Inject actual Q&A content into the mainEntity array for FAQPage schema.

Ensure schema validity and completeness.","Eligibility for FAQ rich snippets, potentially higher CTR from SERPs, better content understanding by search engines."
Low,üñºÔ∏è,[LOW] Optimize In-Browser Image Scaling,Issues/Performances/avoid_scaling_images_in_browser.md,"Images are served larger than their rendered display size and are scaled by the browser, negatively impacting LCP and overall page load performance, especially on mobile devices.","Generate and serve appropriately sized images for different viewports and device pixel ratios using <picture> element or <img srcset> attributes.

Low,‚û°Ô∏è,[LOW] Fix 301 Redirects on Agency UTM Links,Issues/Technical/301/fix_301_utm_agency.md,"Outbound links on agency profile pages that include UTM tracking parameters are causing unnecessary 301 redirects, potentially due to encoding of the full Sortlist URL in utm_campaign or case/protocol issues in the target URL.","Keep UTM tracking but replace the value of utm_campaign with the agency slug only. Ensure the target domain in the href is always lowercase and uses HTTPS. No longer encode the full Sortlist URL in utm_campaign.","Slight improvement in user experience (faster load of external site), cleaner crawl path for bots analyzing outbound links, minor preservation of PageRank (though outbound link PR is complex)."

Ensure future links use this canonical version.","Reduces unnecessary redirect chains, slightly improves user experience (faster navigation to LinkedIn profile), preserves PageRank more directly (even for nofollowed links, direct links are cleaner)."
Low,‚û°Ô∏è,[LOW] Fix 301 Redirect on Footer Blog Link,Issues/Technical/301/fix_301_footer_blog_link.md,"The footer link to the Sortlist blog (e.g., /blog) currently triggers a 301 permanent redirect to the version with a trailing slash (e.g., /blog/).","Update the footer blog link to use the canonical URL with the trailing slash: /blog/. Ensure all internal links to the blog root use this version.","Slight UX improvement (avoids brief redirect flicker), consolidates PageRank to the canonical blog URL, cleaner server logs and analytics."
Low,‚è≥,[LOW] Address Missing or Suboptimal Cache Headers,Issues/Performances/missing-cache-headers-ticket.md,"Static assets (e.g., _next/image URLs) have missing or ineffective cache-control headers (e.g., max-age=0), forcing re-downloads on each visit and degrading performance.","Review server/CDN configuration. Implement long-term cache-control headers (e.g., public, max-age=31536000, immutable) for versioned static assets like images, CSS, and JS.","Improved load times for repeat visitors, reduced server load and bandwidth usage, better overall site performance perception."
Low,‚Ü™Ô∏è,[LOW] Investigate and Address Redirect Script for JS Assets,Issues/Performances/redirect-script-ticket.md,"A JavaScript asset (e.g., from cdn-cgi/challenge-platform) is served via a redirect, introducing unnecessary latency, especially on mobile.","Use the final, resolved URL of the script directly if possible. If managed by Cloudflare/security system, adjust routing to serve the asset directly without redirection.","Reduced page rendering latency, improved Time to Interactive (TTI), elimination of avoidable delay from script redirection."
