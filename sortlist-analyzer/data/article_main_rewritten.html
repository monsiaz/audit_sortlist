<p>The once-niche channel of Connected TV (CTV) has rapidly become a board-room priority. A fresh study from measurement firm DoubleVerify (DV) paints a detailed picture of this evolution, showing soaring ad volume, shifting consumer sentiment and persistent problems that threaten to dilute return on investment if left unchecked.</p>

<h2>Ctv climbs from experiment to essential buy</h2>

<p>Until recently, most agencies parked CTV in the “test and learn” bucket, allocating small pilot budgets to get a feel for the medium. That era is already history. DoubleVerify’s report, “DV Global Insights: Trends in the Modern Streaming Landscape,” states that CTV ad impressions jumped <strong>66% year-over-year in 2024</strong>, an increase too dramatic to dismiss as a fad. Early-adopting territories such as the Netherlands, Indonesia and Singapore are powering that spike, but momentum is clearly global.</p>

<p>CTV, in DV’s definition, is any ad-supported content streamed to internet-connected televisions via apps, smart-TV operating systems or external devices. The format weds the lean-back, full-screen experience of traditional television with the addressability and data richness of digital. That combination explains why many brands now treat CTV as a “must-have” line item rather than an optional experiment.</p>

<p>DV’s chief executive officer, <strong>Mark Zagorski</strong>, frames the shift succinctly: “<em>CTV has become a centerpiece of digital video strategy with huge growth potential for both branding and performance campaigns</em>.” The upside, however, is shadowed by operational risks that could sap both confidence and budgets.</p>

<h2>What the DoubleVerify data tells us</h2>

<p>The DV study blends proprietary measurement signals with a large consumer poll of <strong>22,000 people</strong> across regions. From the buy-side, nearly <strong>2,000 marketers</strong> were surveyed. The headline numbers underline the appetite for the channel:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>72%</strong> of marketers say CTV placements outperform their campaign baselines.</li>
<li><strong>54%</strong> boosted CTV budgets in the past year.</li>
<li>Among brands that have not yet entered CTV, <strong>66%</strong> intend to do so within 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those figures look stellar, yet they coexist with equally eye-catching concerns. Half of all 2024 impressions (<strong>only 50%</strong>) arrived with full app-level transparency, leaving advertisers to guess which publishers actually delivered the remaining half. Lack of visibility is not just an accounting nuisance; it directly influences the efficiency of every dollar spent.</p>

<h2>Consumers warm to ads as subscription fatigue bites</h2>

<p>On the audience side, DoubleVerify’s findings debunk the fear that ad loads alone drive churn. <strong>41% of viewers</strong> now prefer free or lower-cost, ad-funded streaming over purely subscription-based options—a sentiment the report links to subscription fatigue and growing tolerance for relevant advertising.</p>

<p>Viewer tastes also guide how ads should be placed. According to the poll, <strong>64%</strong> of respondents say content genre alters their perception of spots and sponsoring brands. Long-form shows and podcasts, for example, are labeled stronger brand-building arenas than short-form clips. To meet these nuanced expectations, publishers are experimenting with contextual units: pause screens, mid-rolls, dynamic overlays and click-to-WhatsApp executions—all designed to feel less intrusive and more actionable.</p>

<h2>The hidden cost of opacity</h2>

<p>Every emerging medium wrestles with teething troubles, yet the scale of waste documented by DV is sobering. Because of issues ranging from undisclosed placements to the infamous “TV Off” scenario—where a screen goes dark but the stream (and the ad pod) keeps playing—advertisers lose about <strong>US$700,000 per billion impressions</strong>. At first glance that may look like a rounding error for big brands, yet the cumulative impact across global traffic quickly snowballs into multi-million-dollar inefficiencies.</p>

<p>DV’s analysis singles out fraud as the top drain. <strong>Bot fraud now represents 65% of all CTV-related fraud</strong>, propelled by roughly <strong>four million compromised devices every day</strong>. Those devices simulate viewing sessions, generating fake ad calls that siphon budgets away from genuine audiences. Zagorski does not mince words: “<em>A lack of transparency, an increase in rogue behaviour, and the lack of industry operational standards create an environment in which media waste is becoming a growing issue</em>.”</p>

<h2>Fraudulent traffic: anatomy of a budget leak</h2>

<p>Unlike traditional click fraud on desktops, CTV fraud often masquerades as legitimate, full-screen views. Malicious actors spoof device identifiers, apps or even entire operating systems. Because measurement standards for CTV remain patchy, these schemes can live longer undetected, amplifying financial damage. DV’s report illustrates that dynamic through its daily tally of infected devices—enough to justify continual scrutiny by brand-safety teams.</p>

<p>The industry is well aware of the reputational damage such waste can cause. Visibility metrics, viewability audits and sophisticated invalid-traffic (IVT) filters are indispensable, yet widespread adoption is still uneven. Half-measures will not suffice when billions of impressions are at stake.</p>

<h2>Marketers draw a red line under measurement</h2>

<p>Advertisers are not passively absorbing the losses. The research shows <strong>68%</strong> of marketers consider transparency non-negotiable if they are to pay CTV’s premium CPMs. Meanwhile, <strong>63%</strong> concede they struggle to validate whether their buys reach human eyes. That discrepancy is prompting tougher questions during agency reviews and vendor selection.</p>

<p>One marketer quoted in the study captures the mood: “<em>CTV is evolving quickly, but it’s vital that the industry builds in safeguards and common standards before these issues undermine trust</em>.” The call for third-party verification—long standard on desktop and mobile display—has now migrated to the living-room screen.</p>

<h2>The story of DoubleVerify</h2>

<p>Founded as a digital verification pioneer, DoubleVerify has moved aggressively to ensure its measurement stack keeps pace with multi-screen consumption. The firm’s roadmap now spans fraud detection, performance metrics and a new layer of attention measurement tailored for large-screen viewing. Zagorski emphasizes a “<em>technology innovation plus industry collaboration</em>” formula, arguing that cross-player alignment is the only realistic path to a unified framework.</p>

<p>The company’s recent strides include bolstering protection against the “TV Off” loophole, refining app-level taxonomy for faster transparency reporting, and adding outcome-based signals so brands can link CTV inventory with business KPIs. While DV is not the only vendor operating in this space, its ability to benchmark nearly every large market provides a panoramic view unavailable to most ad buyers.</p>

<h2>Why context and format now dominate creative briefs</h2>

<p>With fraud and transparency taking center stage, creative strategy risks becoming an afterthought. Yet DV’s consumer survey makes a powerful counter-argument: relevance and context remain primary drivers of ad receptivity. Brands that align messaging with the mood and genre of the program stand to reap intangible equity benefits, especially in long-form environments such as high-quality TV series and podcasts.</p>

<p>Centrepiece units like pause ads or dynamic overlays are gaining traction because they leverage natural breaks, reducing perceived interruption. Click-to-WhatsApp modules add direct response capability, converting passive awareness into instant engagement. While these executions are still experimental for many marketers, early adopters report upticks in brand recall and interactivity—a promising sign that format innovation can coexist with stricter accountability.</p>

<h2>The roadblocks still slowing down adoption</h2>

<p>Despite rosy growth curves, CTV faces structural hurdles. Fragmentation across device makers, operating systems and app ecosystems injects complexity into basic tasks like frequency capping or exclusion list management. The absence of universal identifiers further complicates reach and de-duplication reporting, encouraging some buyers to lean on “walled-garden” bundles that trade scale for transparency.</p>

<p>Regulation may also reshape the terrain. Privacy statutes around the world increasingly treat household-level data as sensitive, limiting the granularity of targeting that once differentiated CTV. Marketers accustomed to precise digital cohorts will need new playbooks that balance compliance with campaign effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Collaboration as the north star of streaming advertising</h2>

<p>Stakeholders now accept that CTV’s promise will unravel unless verification, publishers and buyers converge on common standards. That spirit of unity underpins DV’s insistence on “technology innovation plus industry collaboration”—a mantra that underscores every chart and footnote in the report.</p>

<p>Indeed, the next 18 months will test whether the industry can translate talk into action. Clearer taxonomies, fraud controls that evolve as fast as scammers, and transparent supply chains are not simply nice-to-have; they are prerequisites for sustaining the channel’s meteoric rise.</p>

<p><i>CTV’s ascent proves the appetite for premium, data-driven video is enormous—but only relentless transparency will keep that appetite from turning into skepticism.</i></p>
